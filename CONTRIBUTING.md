Useful steps to work on the source code and generated bindings in this repository.

## Regenerating Bindings

This crate contains bindings generated by `bindgen`. Typically, the included bindings can be used as-is, but if needed they can be regenerated by running `cargo run -p bindings_generator`.  Updated headers and licenses should be copied to the `./bindings_generator/vendor/` folder.
